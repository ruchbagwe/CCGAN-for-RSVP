# CCGAN-for-RSVP
In this project, the P300 event occurred due to the shift in attention is analyzed and captured using the electroencephalogram (EEG).
Using this analysis, a model called Cortically-Coupled Generative Adversarial Network is proposed.
This model identifies and retrieves the target image in rapid serial visual presentation(RSVP) events.
